# About this repo

After reading this Medium article titled "How to Build a Relational Database From Scratch,
Opening the black box of relational databases" by "Trivadar Danka" about databases and relational calculus, I decided
to write my own Julia implementation.

This is a naive implementation (using Julia's built in Sets and structs) of relational calculus operations. Mainly this repo contains scripts for the selection, proyection and some other classical operations common to RC.
