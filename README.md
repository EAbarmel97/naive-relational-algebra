# About this repo:

After reading [this Medium article](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-build-a-relational-database-from-scratch-e208061027c7) titled `How to Build a Relational Database From Scratch,
Opening the black box of relational databases` by Trivadar Danka, I decided
to write my own Julia implementation based on his.

This is a naive implementation (using Julia's OrderedDicts and Sets). Mainly this repo contains scripts implementing basic operations common in Relational Algebra like selection, projection, rename, etc. 

NOTE: If you want to dig a little bit deeper on this, give Neso Academy's You Tube chanel a try [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76v3gRns28U&list=PLdnwl-gHn1DFIbW82OIyO21lke98MAOKk).
