# About this repo:

After reading this Medium article titled `How to Build a Relational Database From Scratch,
Opening the black box of relational databases` by `Trivadar Danka` about databases and relational calculus, I decided
to write my own Julia implementation based on his Python implementation.

This is a naive implementation (using Julia's built-in sets and structs) of relational algebra operations. Mainly this repo contains scripts classical operations common in RC, like selection, projection, rename, etc.
